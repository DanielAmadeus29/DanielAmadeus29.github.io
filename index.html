                <p>Hello, I'm Daniel, and I am a sophomore international student at Fujen Catholic University majoring in Computer Science and Information Engineering. As you can see in the description above. Yes, I'm originally not from Taiwan, I'm from Indonesia. As a non-native Mandarin speaker, sometimes i feel a little 
                bit challenging when dealing with Mandarin. No matter what, i must improve my Mandarin because i live in a Mandarin speaker environment. A little about me,
                I like playing games,piano and I listen to Music a lot. I'll put my spotify link below, maybe you can find any good songs from my playlist? Who knows. Alright, so this
                is a short Introduction about me. You can also follow my Instagram down below if you want, Thank you !!!</p>
