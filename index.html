    <h1>Hello,<br>I'm Daniel Amadeus</h1>
        <br><br>
        <p>I am a Sophomore International Student at Fujen Catholic University Majoring in Computer Science and Information Engineering. Just wanna let you know, I'm originally not from Taiwan, I'm from Indonesia. As a non-native Mandarin speaker, sometimes I feel a little 
            bit challenging when dealing with Mandarin. No matter what, I must improve my Mandarin because I live in a Mandarin speaker environment. A little about me,
            I like playing games, piano and I listen to Music a lot. I'll put my spotify link below, maybe you can find any good songs from my playlist? Who knows. Alright, so this
            is a short Introduction about me. You can also follow my Instagram down below if you want, Thank you !!!</p>

        <p>Date/Place of Birth  : Jakarta, 29 December 2003</p>
